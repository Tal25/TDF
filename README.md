# TDF
Salam! This is where I’m dropping all my fun TDF projects (Electronics + Fabrication) — plus a bonus collection of Professor Sudkhu’s legendary shirts. 🚀👕

## WEEK 1 (Sep 2 -> Sep 9)
### Electronics:
This week’s challenge was to get cozy with Arduino: flashing LEDs, saying “Hello World,” and then making things a bit more interesting with light sensors and multiple LEDs.

I followed Sudhu Tewari’s Arduino workshop tutorial and got my hands dirty with LEDs, sensors, and lots of jumper wires. I made it through the LED + LDR + RGB sections (stopped right before the buttons), and along the way I played with the code, broke things, fixed them, and made some happy accidents

##### Hello World + Blink

I combined the “Hello World” program with the onboard LED blink. Suddenly the Arduino was talking and winking at me through the serial monitor. It felt like it was alive.

Reflection: Seeing text + light in sync gave me my first real sense of hardware/software blending — one eye in the digital world, one eye in the physical.
***
LED + LDR

I wired up a light sensor so the LED brightness changed depending on the room light. When I covered the LDR, the LED glowed stronger, like it was scared of the dark.

Reflection: This was the first moment the circuit felt like it had a little personality.
***
Two-LED Light Dance

I hooked up two LEDs with staggered delays. At first they blinked out of sync (chaos mode), then I adjusted the timing until it looked like they were chasing each other across the breadboard.

Reflection: Timing is design. Even tiny changes in delay turned a messy blink into a little story.
***
RGB LED Experiments

I faded through colors and mapped the LDR values to brightness. Covering the sensor painted the LED in deeper colors — it was like making shadows into pigments. 🌈

Reflection: This was the most magical part: turning everyday light into color shifts.
